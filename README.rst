TheFekete's gEDA Configuration
##############################

This is my local ``~/.gEDA`` / ``~/.pcb`` configuration directory. You can see
my custom symbols and footprints under lib/. Use at your own risk!

Installation
============

To use this on your machine:

  - clone the repo to your home dir
  - backup your old config: ``mv ~/.gEDA ~/.gEDA_old && mv ~/.pcb ~/.pcb_old``
  - change the name of the repo's directory to .gEDA
  - add a symlink to pcb in your home: ``ln -s ~/.gEDA/pcb ~/.pcb``
